_I stumbled across an event page about AWS Q CLI, and thought, “Why not actually try it out?”_ 😎

### 🎮 Why I Chose This Game

Since it was my very first time using AWS Q CLI, I wanted to keep things simple rather than building something complex.

I started thinking about what kind of game would be simple and fun—and then inspiration struck. I remembered I used to enjoy "poop-dodging" games as a kid.

Coincidentally, my cat was doing its business nearby at the time, so the idea just clicked 🐈

### 💡 Prompting Techniques That Worked

Before diving into the actual development, I realized the importance of solid planning. So I started by asking AWS Q CLI to generate a development plan outlining the game’s concept and structure. Then, I gave specific, detailed prompts based on that plan—adding features and design elements one by one.

The key was to be as clear and detailed as possible in my prompts to avoid any misunderstanding. The more concrete I was, the closer the results were to what I had envisioned.

### 🧠 How AI Tackled Classic Programming Challenges

Without AWS Q CLI, I would have had to debug errors one by one on my own. But with it, I was able to troubleshoot just by chatting in natural language, like asking a skilled teammate for help. It honestly felt like having a senior developer by my side.

On top of that, AWS Q CLI handled things like infrastructure setup and syntax issues, so I could focus on game logic and design. This made the entire development experience much smoother and more enjoyable.

### ⚙️ Development Automation That Saved Me Time

Game development often involves spending a lot of time thinking through and documenting folder structures, design guidelines, and game mechanics. But AWS Q CLI made this part a breeze. With just a few commands, it auto-generated markdown documentation outlining the whole project structure and guidelines. That saved a huge amount of time.

Although I didn’t get around to trying it myself, I noticed from other blogs and YouTube tutorials that even deployment—like uploading to AWS S3 can be done with just a few simple commands. Super convenient.

### 🖼️ Interesting AI-Generated Code Examples

One prompt I gave was:

`I'll be using SVG images for the game. Please generate wireframes and icon buttons as SVGs and integrate them into the code`

What amazed me was how it actually created visual assets—almost like using Photoshop—and applied them to the code. The first set wasn’t quite what I wanted, but with more specific prompts, the improved versions were exactly what I had in mind. I was genuinely impressed 💩
